We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.


public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        if (n == 1){return 1;}
        double a = n;
        double move = Math.ceil (a / 4);
        int guess = (int) Math.ceil (a / 2);
        int res = guess (guess);
        while (res != 0){
            if (res < -0){guess -= (int) move; move = Math.ceil(move / 2);}
            else if (res > 0){guess += (int) move; move = Math.ceil(move / 2);}
            res = guess (guess);
        }
        return guess;
    }
}
